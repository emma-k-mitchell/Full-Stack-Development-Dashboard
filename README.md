# Full-Stack-Development-Dashboard

### Project Scenario
As a developer for Global Rain, a software company, I was tasked with developing a web application for Grazioso Salvare, a company that works with shelter dogs to find specific breeds best suited for rescue training. The application pulls from a database with existing data from various animal shelters about the animals residing at each location. Development on this project was broken into three stages: MongoDB authentication and indexing, implimenting Python middle-ware CRUD functionality, and the development of the Python web application.

### Development and Experience
My work on this project resulted in a Python web application that allows users to search through a database, via a dashboard, to better visualize the data as well as identify and categorize database members. This was my first introduction to full-stack development, and from this class, I gained experience developing client/server applications that interface with client-side code via databases. Included in this repository is my README word document, animal_shelter.py file, and ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb file. The README document was updated over the 7 weeks of development to clearly document the project's development, functionality, and purpose. The .py and .ipynb files can be uploaded into Jupyter notebook to view the product for yourself. 

### Functionality
Below is a screenshot of the finished dashboard. The application uses a dropdown menu to filter results.

Below the returned results, I implimented a geo-location map that shows the location of the first animal from the results above. This can be adjusted or removed to best fit the needs of the user.

### Skills Gained from Project
- Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. 

I worked to make my code maintainable, readable, and adaptable thoughout each stage of development. I followed best practices, implimented any and all changes/suggestions by my professor, and heavily commented my code. Doing so resulted in readable code that could easily be re-used in future projects. My code is adaptable and can be updated by the user to best suit their needs. Because my code was written in these ways, I was able to use the same CRUD module for many of my milsetone assignments, only updating it as needed.
- Identifiying and resolving issues encountered during development. 

I faced quite a few issues while developing this project. I addressed and resolved these issues using one or more of these strategies: researching the issue/reading documentation, trial and error, and reaching out to help from my professor and peers. As my classes advance, I have begun to see the benifit of working with others to complete assignments. I believe this is good because an internship and full-time positon will require me to work in team settings when developing products.
- Experience will full-stack development. 

My work on this project gave me hands-on experience with full stack development. The prodct I developed was done so to help a buisness resolve an issue that they brought to my attention. I developed the product they requested accourding to their specifications and requirements.
